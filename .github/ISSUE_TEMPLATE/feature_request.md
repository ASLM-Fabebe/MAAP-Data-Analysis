**Analysis Module:**  
_Select one:_ AMR / AMC / AMU / Data Processing / Visualization / User Interface / Cross-Module

**Problem Statement**  
_What analysis challenge or limitation does this feature address?_

**Proposed Solution**  
_Describe how the feature should work. Include UI/workflow details._

**Research/Clinical Impact**  
_How will this improve AMR/AMC/AMU analysis workflows? Who benefits?_

**Regulatory/Compliance Context**  
- [ ] Required for GLASS reporting
- [ ] Supports WHO surveillance guidelines  
- [ ] Improves data quality for regulatory submission
- [ ] Enhances CLSI/EUCAST compliance
- [ ] Other compliance need: ________________
- [ ] No regulatory impact

**Implementation Scope**  
_Check all that apply:_
- [ ] R script modifications
- [ ] Shiny app interface changes
- [ ] New visualization outputs
- [ ] Data validation enhancements
- [ ] Export format additions
- [ ] Integration with external tools
- [ ] Performance improvements
- [ ] Documentation updates

**Acceptance Criteria**  
Main success scenario
```gherkin
Given I have [type] data loaded in the system
When I access the new [feature name] functionality
Then I can [primary action]
And the system generates [expected output]
And the results are saved to [location/format]
```

Alternative scenarios
Scenario: Invalid input handling
```gherkin
Given I provide malformed or incomplete data
When I attempt to use the new feature
Then I receive clear error messages
And the system suggests corrective actions
```

Scenario: Large dataset performance
```gherkin
Given I have a dataset with >10,000 records
When I run the new analysis
Then it completes within a reasonable time (<5 minutes)
And memory usage remains acceptable
```

**Sample Data Context**  
- [ ] I can provide sanitized sample data to test this feature
- [ ] This feature can be tested with existing test data
- [ ] This requires specific data types/formats

**References/Examples**  
_Links to research papers, WHO guidelines, similar tools, or regulatory requirements._

**Priority Level**  
_Select one:_
- [ ] **Low** - Nice to have for future versions
- [ ] **Medium** - Would improve current research workflows  
- [ ] **High** - Important for comprehensive surveillance
- [ ] **Critical** - Required for regulatory compliance or core functionality
