- [ ] **Troubleshooting Guide** - Common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Code Comments** - In-script documentation
- [ ] **Output Interpretation** - Results explanation
- [ ] **API/Function Documentation** - Technical reference

**Current Location**  
_Specify file path, URL, or section:_

**Issue Description**  
_What is unclear, missing, outdated, or incorrect?_

**Suggested Improvement**  
_How should it be updated? Include specific text changes if possible._

**Missing Gherkin Examples**

**Acceptance Criteria**  
Documentation completeness
```gherkin
Given the updated documentation
When a [target user type] follows the instructions
Then they successfully complete [specific task]
And they understand [key concepts]
And they can troubleshoot common issues independently
```
Clarity verification
```gherkin
Given a new user reads the documentation
When they encounter [specific scenario]
Then the information is clear and actionable
And they don't need to consult external resources
```

**Validation Method**  
_How can we verify the documentation improvement works?_
- [ ] Test with a new user following the updated instructions
- [ ] Validate against common support questions
- [ ] Check completeness against similar projects
- [ ] Review with domain experts (clinical/laboratory staff)
